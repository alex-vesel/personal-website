                            <p class="">This article describes some of my initial experiments with real-world robotic manipulation.  While I read many papers on robotic manipulation as part of my Masters at Stanford and worked on hand position sensing for Teslaâ€™s Optimus when I interned there in the summer of 2023, I figured there is no better way to learn about robotic manipulation than to try and do it in the real world</p>
